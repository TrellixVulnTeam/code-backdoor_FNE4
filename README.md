# Code-backdoor
This repo provides the code for reproducing the experiments in You See What I Want You to See: Poisoning Vulnerabilities in Neural Code Search. For CodeBERT,  we directly use the released pre-trained model by [Feng et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08155.pdf). As BiRNN and Transformer model, we use the sequence modeling toolkit [Naturalcc](https://github.com/CGCL-codes/naturalcc)
